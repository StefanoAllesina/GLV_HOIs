Try just inputing the diversity of the communities to julia, but nothing else. Then do the merging in the analysis part in r. If I do subcommunities, my diversity will be always the same (a vector of repeated numbers). If I do different communities my diversity will be a vector fo numbers that may or may not be different. If I do different communities and subcommunities my diversity will be a vector of repeated numbers followed by numbers that may or may not be repeated etc. Since I have which roots are corresponding to each parameter set, the correspondance is one to one and I can merge easily in R later
